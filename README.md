# DerivativesPricing
Pricing of financial derivatives using Monte Carlo simulations [with python]

Goal of the Jupyter notebook:

Studying the speed of convergence of the Monte Carlo (MC) estimation of a call option price in the Black Scholes (BS) framework, and study the convergence of the MC estimator of the BS price.

Estimating the sensitivities of the price to an increase of $\sigma$ (vega) or the interest rate $r$ (rho) ? Comparing to the BS closed formulas.

Computing by finite difference, using MC, the sensitivity to a move of the underlying (well known as the Delta...); and studying the convergence speed of the Delta (number of simulations becoming bigger and bigger).

Explaining how MC estimations behave when we get closer to the maturity.
